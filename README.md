# Small Todo List made with React, Typescript and PicoCSS 📋

A simple todo list I made for practicing programing with typescript and React 🤓⚛️

This project uses Vite + SWC for compiling/bundling files.


## If you want to run a developer instance:

    eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0
